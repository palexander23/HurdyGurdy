# Electronic Hurdy Gurdy PCB

This repository contains PCB design files, that will go towards the eventual creation of an electronic Hurdy Gurdy.

This is a stand-in README that will likely be rewritten once the project starts taking off.

I do not intend this project to be seen widely, it's just a place for me to keep stuff.

This project was heavily inspired by the [Digi-Gurdy](https://hackaday.io/project/165251-the-digi-gurdy-and-diginerdygurdy) and much of the mechanical design for my instrument will likely be drawn from there.
